A python project which uses autoencoders to train a model which colourizes images
It also provides training and vaildation accuracy/losses graphs

This code requires a training set consisting of grey and coloured images. 
For the accuracy to be improved, more data needs to be used to train/validate, however due to RAM limitations on google colab this is the maximum i was able to train it with
